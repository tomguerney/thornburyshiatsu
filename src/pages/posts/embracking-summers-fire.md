Summer arrives, a blazing display where Fire energy ascends to its highest point, marking the zenith of yang in the East Asian cycle. Life bursts forth, and the longest days naturally foster connection and outward expansion. Pure joy is our easiest emotion, and meaningful connection is the deepest source of healing. On Wurundjeri Country, this is Buath Gurru—a season of abundant growth. Our inner state mirrors the world: as we reach outward, our hearts naturally seek to expand.

Guiding Principles: Heart and Discernment

The Heart and Small Intestine, the Fire organs, lead us. The Heart distributes our essential vitality, while the Small Intestine determines what nourishment to embrace and what to discard.

They provoke these vital inquiries:
- What activities truly spark your delight?
- Which matters merit your focused attention?
- What relationships truly sustain your spirit?

With this intense surge of summer vitality, employing discernment is crucial. We must choose wisely where to focus our strength, ensuring our inner fire brings warmth rather than consuming our reserves.

Shiatsu: The Path to Balance

The wisdom of Shiatsu teaches that even during this most active time, equilibrium is the key to enduring vitality.

To maintain this delicate balance:
- Nourishment: Favour lighter, naturally cooling foods (cucumber, watermelon, bitter greens). Hydrate with water infused with citrus or mint.
- Rhythm: Rise to meet the sun. Seek repose during midday heat; find shelter or refresh your feet in cool water.
- Spirit: Intentionally make space for celebration and heartfelt laughter. Crucially, balance this external activity with moments of profound stillness.

The deep, calming touch of Shiatsu provides a balanced exchange of energies—the cool hand that ensures your fire is contained, allowing it to warm and energise rather than overpower.

May your summer be both vibrant and deeply harmonious. I wish you a heart that is wide open yet always wise, and a fire that burns with bright, enduring power.
